  <p style="text-align:center;">HI <em>EVERYONE!</em> </p>
  <p style="text-align:center;">My name is <strong>Suemy Valenzuela</strong>, and I am 16 years old. I was born in <strong>Lima, Peru</strong>. I arrived to the United States three years ago in search of a brighter future for my family and myself. I can speak English, Spanish, and I am currently learning Mardarin. I enjoy learning new things, and one of the things I'm learning right now is <strong>HTML coding</strong>.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;">I created this page to tell you a little bit about myself. </p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center; color:#9400D3;">&#128187;Why Am I Interested In Coding?&#128187;</h2>
  <p style="text-align:center;">When I was <em>younger</em>, I was fascinated by how individuals created web pages and how they provided information, entertainment, and other services to people. I'm finding coding to be a lot of <strong>fun</strong> and <strong>entertaining</strong> now that I'm learning it. Coding appeals to me since it appears to be a means of expressing one's <em>creativity and self-expression</em>. We can push ourselves and achieve amazing things with coding. Coding interests me because it allows me to address logic problems in a creative and enjoyable manner. Coding is also a component of <strong>future technology</strong>, which I want to be a part of. </p>
